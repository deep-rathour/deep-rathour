### Hi, I'm Sandeep Rathour, Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Python Developer based in Melbourne with 16+ years of experience in government, marketing, and hospitality, I excel in developing effective marketing strategies, managing projects, and exceeding targets.

However, my current excitement lies in exploring the realm of software development, particularly with Python. The process of problem-solving and leveraging the capabilities of computer systems inspires me greatly.

As a highly motivated and results-driven professional, I am now actively seeking entry-level roles in software development.

and, ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to utilise Django Framework to build highly capable e-commerce website. please check my credetials @ http://www.sandeeprathour.com
