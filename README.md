### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Python Developer based in Melbourne with 16+ years of experience in government, marketing, and hospitality, I excel in developing effective marketing strategies, managing projects, and exceeding targets.
However, my current excitement lies in exploring the realm of software development, particularly with Python. The process of problem-solving and leveraging the capabilities of computer systems inspires me greatly.
As a highly motivated and results-driven professional, I am now actively seeking entry-level roles in software development.
